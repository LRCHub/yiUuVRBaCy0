This wicked world

You let the heart attack in
One taste and it's all good

Then the little birds sing
But the world couldn't bear it
And the song that it sang
Made me so aware

We lost something big
So only come if you want
Make me
Not getting any younger

And the little birds sing
And the world couldn't keep it
And the song that it sang
Made me so aware

Cat's eye blue sky, let go
Let the light of the moon open your eyes
Cash your chip, come on
Same damn talk, it's real though
Let the light of the moon open your eyes

Been a shipwreck babe
I sing 'cause I've seen it
Ain't perfect baby
You can hear when I sing

Little bird on the wing
Almsot too quiet to notice

It makes me so aware

Cat's eye blue sky, let go
Let the light of the moon open your eyes
Cash your chip, come on
Same damn talk, it's real though
Let the light of the moon open your eyes

Cat's eye blue sky, let go
Let the light of the moon open your eyes
Cash your chip, come on
Same damn talk, it's real though
Let the light of the moon open your eyes
