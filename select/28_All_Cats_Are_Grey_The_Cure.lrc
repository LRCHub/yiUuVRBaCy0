[02:18.55] I never thought that I would find myself
[02:26.58] In bed amongst the stones
[02:33.14] The columns are all men begging to crush me
[02:41.43] No shapes sail on the dark deep lakes
[02:47.62] And no flags wave me home
[03:00.12] 
[02:54.08] In the caves, all cats are grey
[02:58.27] In the caves, the texture coats my skin
[03:03.64] In the death cell, a single note rings on and on and on
