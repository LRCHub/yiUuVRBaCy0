I was walking in the evening, I was
Looking for something good, clean, fine,
Pure, straight, but instead I found
The bunker wall and gate.

It was open: I was free. I gave a
Token guarantee; though I later knew I
Had promised more, with an I.O.U.
I could scarcely score my way... Oh! But I herald Apocalypse anyway!
I was a prime believer in the faith
Of 'I': yellow fever in the cat's eye.

And it's everything you
Want, own, love, hate, touch, dream,
Trust; and it's everything you need.

I got a heart like a rochet, I
Was out of control, I'd cleaned out
My pockets for some luck to show...
Really looking like a hopeless case,
I found it in my hand, it was
The Angry Ace. He wants to talk to
Me, one on one, he wants to give
Me his professional opinion... but
I'm running; I just can't wait,
I haven't got a moment to anticipate;
Yes, I'm running, I just can't stop,
I've got to get to the bottom just to
Get to the top, I've got the dark
Alleys and the open skies, I got
The yellow fever from the cat's eye.

I'll let you know how it goes in the ninth life.
