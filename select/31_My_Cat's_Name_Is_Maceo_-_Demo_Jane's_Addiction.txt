My cat's name is Maceo
He's a little man in a cats body
He yawns just like I do
He's convinced I won't eat him
I think he thinks that I'm his dad
Because I saved him from the pound
Well we went down
Down to the pound and that's where we saw Maceo
Cat catcher said to me
"Pick one out"
Maceo said
"Let me out"
He sleeps right where I do and we wrestle in the morning!
He come to you if you don't bother him
He just likes to do his own thing
My cat's name is Maceo
He's a little man in a cat's body
