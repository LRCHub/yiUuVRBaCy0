I can see you're keeping your distance
We're neither touching nor apart

Cat's eyes glow white in reassurance
We're nearer to the end than to the start

I look at screens a hundred times longer than I look into
Your eyes

Who am I?
Whatever I touch turns to
I'm a mayfly caught in a strobe
I'm a program waiting to load

I talk before I've thought of an answer
Crossing out our common ground

You turn away, your face in blue
Being whoever you are to the others
Who am I?
Whatever I touch turns to
I'm a program waiting to load
I'm a mayfly caught in a strobe

There will be other roads
Wherever we go
But I reached my limit at our intersection

And now we only touch
At our inbetween
And I'm tired of being just a reflection

Am I just a Cat's Eye?
Will I find no light of my own?

Who am I?
Whatever I touch turns to
I'm a program waiting to load
Who am I?
Whatever I touch turns to
I'm a mayfly caught in a strobe
