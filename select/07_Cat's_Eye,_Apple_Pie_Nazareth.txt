Cat's eye, apple pie, what am I gonna do?
The woman I loved walked out on me.
What am I gonna do?
Hound dog, bullfrog, she just up and gone,
The woman I love has done me wrong.
What am I gonna do?
Green beans, black-eyed peas,
What am I gonna do?
The woman I love has let me down.
What am I gonna do?

She's a delta queen, you know what I mean,
As mean as wildfire lightnin',
She can win and break the heart of any man.
She's the delta queen of New Orleans,
And she loved me somethin' frightnin',
But she left me for a dollar wavin' man.
